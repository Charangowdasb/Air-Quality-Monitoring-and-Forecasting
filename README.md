# Air Quality Monitoring and Forecasting

## Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on air quality data to understand patterns, trends, and relationships between different air quality parameters.

## Project Files
- **CHARAN24PG00072.ipynb** - Jupyter notebook containing the complete EDA analysis
- **data_air.csv** - Dataset containing air quality measurements

## Dataset
The `data_air.csv` file contains air quality monitoring data with various parameters including:
- Date and time information
- Air quality indices
- Pollutant concentrations
- Meteorological parameters

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn


2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```

## Usage
1. Open Jupyter Notebook:

2. Run the cells to explore the air quality data and generate visualizations

## Analysis Includes
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Statistical analysis of air quality parameters
- Correlation analysis
- Time series analysis (if applicable)
- Data insights and conclusions
